            <p>
                This site is a pit of chaos with absolutely no organization or structure. This of course leads to a very
                bad user experience and makes it hard to know where to go for what you need. The only positive aspect
                of this site is the contrast, which is fine since nothing is hard to see due to the colors being
                different than their suroundings.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The contrast is fine since nothing is hard to see due to the colors being to similar only
                    from the crowdedness</li>
                <li>Repetition: The only repetition on this site is the pure chaos of colors and borders, there is no
                    color scheme or repetition of any kind</li>
                <li>Alignment: There is absolutely no alignment on this site, everything is thrown together and moved
                    arouind just to it all fits together</li>
                <li>Proximity: There is no spacing between the elements, and looks so crowded</li>
            </ul>
